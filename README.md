# ZoomAutomation Project

> :sparkles: **Note:** This project is designed for Windows.

This project allows for automatic joining and leaving of Zoom meetings using the provided `main.py` script and the functions included in `zoomFuncs.py`. You will need to add your own Zoom meeting codes and passwords to make it work.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nguyenttleo/ZoomAutomation.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open `main.py` and update the following variables with your Zoom meeting information:

   ```python
